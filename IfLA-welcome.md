Welcome to the department. Some useful info:

### Personal info in the university system
To make your university accounts work properly across platforms, it's important that the university system has your correct personal info. If you notice that it isn't correct, you can contact the department of human resources (Dezernat 4 -- Personal).

## Teaching and classes
### Managing exams
* In the intranet for employees, there is information on how to organize your courses on C@mpus and ILIAS [here](https://www.izus.uni-stuttgart.de/itap/campus/co-hauptprozesse/lehrveranstaltung/) (only in German). 
* In the intranet for employees, you also find information on how to enter dates for exams and term papers [here](https://www.izus.uni-stuttgart.de/itap/campus/co-hauptprozesse/pruefung/) (also only in German). 
* Good to know: On C@mpus, you need to set up one examination date (term paper or exam) for each module that is assigned to your course. You can find the relevant modules and their assigned number (Prüfungsnummer) in the KVV, that Ralf Bothner sends around before the semester starts, below your course description. On C@mpus, search for the respective number assigned to the module and create a new date for those modules that are missing.
* Good to know: If students failed an exam, or are sick, they can sign up for a repeat exam (Wiederholungsprüfung) even outside of the regular exam sign-up period. A condition for this is that they orignally signed up for the first exam during the sign-up period.

### Some tips for using ILIAS

Class contents will be provided to the students on the online platform ILIAS. An ILIAS page for each of your classes will be created automatically before each semester. You can edit the contents, and then finally publish it when you are ready for students to see it.

* Good to know: In the settings for a course, you can enter the period of time during which this class is taught. This will cause current classes to show up on the top of the list of classes for people that are signed up for it. Without this, classes are not sorted by term or date, and even current classes show up lower in the list.
* Another way of dealing with this would be marking your current courses as favorites (but in that case, this solution will not affect the way your class is displayed for students).

### Modules and students
#### Study programs
Students in your courses can be enrolled in one of the following study programs below:
* BA or MA Anglistik
* BA or MA English Lehramt (Education)
* MA EASEL (This is a very international group. The linguistic background of the students from this programm is very diverse.)
* MA or BA Computer linguistics
* B.Sc./M.Sc. Wirtschaftspädagogik (Economic Education) at Hohenheim University

You might have a very mixed group from the different study programs in your course.

#### Different number of credits for the same course
Mostly in the advanced courses, but also in introductory courses, students will take your course for different modules. The different modules are not always worth the same amount of ECTS points. So, it is common that you will have to create different tasks for 3, 6, and 9 ECTS points for the same class.
* Here is an example of how to deal with this for term papers: The length of the term paper depends on the number of credits, e.g., 2000 words per 3 credits. The task could be reduced for 3 ECTS.
* Here is an example of how to deal with this for exams: We usually do not offer exams for 3 ECTS. So everybody writes an exam for 6 ECTS. For 9 ECTS, there is an additional 3 ECTS take-home exam which counts one third of the grade, while the exam counts two thirds.

### Students from PH Ludwigsburg and Hohenheim University
Some of our courses are open for students from the PH Ludwigsburg and Hohenheim University. Those students are special cases in many respects:
* They cannot register for courses on C@mpus. So they will inform you some time before the semester starts. We intend to offer them a spot if they ask.
* They cannot register for the ILIAS course. We have to enter them manually with their user name. They can tell you.
* They cannot register for exams/term papers. Hence, after grading we send them a certificate about their grade for Hohenheim ([pdf](https://www.pse-stuttgart-ludwigsburg.de/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Anerkennungsformular-f%C3%BCr-Lehramtsstudierende-der-Uni-Stuttgart-und-Hohenheim.pdf)) or for PH Ludwigsburg ([pdf](https://www.pse-stuttgart-ludwigsburg.de/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Anerkennungsformular-f%C3%BCr-Lehramtsstudierende-der-PH-Ludwigsburg.pdf)).

### Room 2.11 in Breitscheidstraße 2b
You need a special adapater in this room for connecting your computer to the projector. You can get the adapter from Ralf. When you first connect your computer, a software is automatically downloaded from the internet. So make sure you have an internet connection, e.g., via eduroam.


## Resources for research
### Institute library
To check out books from the Institute Library, ask Ralf to email them your personal information and confirm your employment at the institute. Then, they will allow you to check out books for 4 weeks, or a full semester, by filling out a paper form.

### Reimbursements
* The forms for this change occasionally, always use the current one. They can be found [here](https://www.verwaltung.uni-stuttgart.de/formulare/#dienstreisen) (German only).

* I can provide some instructions about filling our forms for reimbursements, when I process my next reimbursement request in the following couple of weeks (LH).

#### Foreign degrees
Foreign degress that are equivalent to a german doctorate, the department of human resources (Dezernat 4 -- Personal) may not enter the degree correctly. Even though it seems like they should know which degrees are equivalent to a German doctorate, sometimes you need to prove to them that your degree is. 

Here is the legal basis for the equivalence (in German). Stated for US-American degrees, and my previous university. The links show a list of countries and universities, respectively, though, and you can make the argument analogously for degrees from other universities/countries. I sent this to the HR department (Ingrid Heinold) to get them to update my degree in the system (in German):

> Beschluss der Kultusministerkonferenz vom 21.09.2001 i. d. F. vom 28.05.2021, Artikel 4.6:
> Inhaber von folgenden Doktorgraden: […]
> 4.6. Vereinigte Staaten von Amerika: „Doctor of Philosophy“
>> Abk.: „Ph.D.“, sofern die verleihende Einrichtung von der „Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching“ als „R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity“ [...] klassifiziert ist,
> können anstelle der im Herkunftsland zugelassenen oder nachweislich allgemein üblichen Abkürzungen die Abkürzung „Dr.“ jeweils ohne fachlichen Zusatz und Herkunftsbezeichnung führen. 

 Im nachfolgenden Text (S. 11, f) gibt es dazu noch eine weitere Erklärung, die besagt dass die Carnegie Klassifizierung auf der Website der Carnegie Foundation (https://carnegieclassifications.acenet.edu/lookup/lookup.php) nachzuschauen ist.

Hier können sie sehen, dass diese Uni als "Doctoral Universities: Very High Research Activity” klassifiziert ist
