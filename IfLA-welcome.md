# IfLA Onboarding Doc

Welcome to the department. Some useful info:

## Your university account 


## Log in to c@mpus (LH)

Link to university pages about the c@mpus portal. [DE](https://www.student.uni-stuttgart.de/uni-a-bis-z/CMPUS--Das-Campus-Management-Portal-der-Universitaet-Stuttgart/)[EN](https://www.student.uni-stuttgart.de/en/digital-services/campus/)

Your campus username is your employee user account (acXXXXXX).

## 2. Login info for email client (LH)

## 3. Managing courses and exams
In the intranet for employees, there is information on how to organize your courses on C@mpus and ILIAS (only in German). [DE](https://www.izus.uni-stuttgart.de/itap/campus/co-hauptprozesse/lehrveranstaltung/) You also find information on how to enter dates for exams and term papers (also only in German). [DE](https://www.izus.uni-stuttgart.de/itap/campus/co-hauptprozesse/pruefung/)

You need to set up one examination date (term paper or exam) for each module that is assigned to your course. You can find the relevant modules and their assigned number (Pr√ºfungsnummer) in the KVV, that Ralf Bothner sends around before the semester starts, below your course description. On C@mpus, search for the respective number assigned to the module and create a new date for those modules that are missing.

## 4. Some tips for using ILIAS

Kurszeitraum angeben (LH)

Mark your current courses as favorites. This way you don't have to courses that you taught in the previous semesters.

## Advanced-Kurse
### Different number of credits for the same course
Mostly in the advanced courses, but also in introductory courses, students will take your course for different modules. The different modules are not always worth the same amount of ECTS points. So, it is common that you will have to create different tasks for 3, 6, and 9 ECTS points for the same class.


Here is an example of how to deal with this for term papers: The length of the term paper depends on the number of credits, e.g., 2000 words per 3 credits. The task could be reduced for 3 ECTS.


Here is an example of how to deal with this for exams: We usually do not offer exams for less than 3 ECTS. So everybody writes an exam for 6 ECTS. For 9 ECTS, there is an additional 3 ECTS take-home exam which counts one third of the grade, while the exam counts two thirds.

### MA EASEL students
The linguistic background of the students from the MA EASEL programm is very diverse given that they are a very international group. Some of them have very little linguistic background, which makes it very hard for them to take our advanced courses, especially for those who chose the Literature track in the MA EASEL and have to take just one import module from linguistics. We want to try to clearly communicate to these students what our requirements are, but we also want to take into account their potential disadvantage.

## Personal info in the university system

It's important that the university system has your correct personal info. If you notice that it isn't correct, you can contact the Personalabteilung.
